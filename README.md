# INTRODUCTION
- Student record system design project works on N-tire architecture which is best model for implementing concepts of distributed application design and architecture. Main aim of this project is to implement a intranet application which manages entire students information from coursers , address, education details, marks in each semester and also each subject and outcome of their studies. Data maintained in this application can be viewed by academic staff and administrator across the university.  This application also provides result module through which students can know there results through online.The Student Record Management system offer users (Registrar) with a unified view of data from multiple sources. The main objective of this project is to build a student database system that will store records of students. It is purposed to reduce time spent on administrative tasks.
# RESEARCH
- in this project report students can find detailed study on this system explanation on each module,spiral model iagram,context level diagram.students can learn basics on N-tire architecture with detailed explanantion on presantation layer,business layer,data acess layer,dtabase layer.

# SWOT ANALYSIS
- Strength - i am a fast learner and a good communicator.
- Weakness - One of my greatest weakness is my limited hardware knowledge.
- Opportunity - Students are more technologically savvy, and recent teacher graduates are more aware of techology available to them.
- Threats - R threat to implementing more technology is selling the benefits to thosw involved.
# 5W's & 1H
- Who -  Any person from a student to a professional can take up this project as there is a huge scope to implementing more and more functions and features within a function and make the code more effecient and robust
- What - the process of analysis of the code, enthusiasts can figure out how to work on a real-life problem, find solutions to any problems and have workarounds for it. Analysis of how to implement a problem and apply the theoritical knowledge.
- Why -   this can be used for analysis and for better understanding of the c-language.
- When - This can be implemented anytime and is easy to implement on any IDE or Compiler.
- How - The objective is to implement theory to practise.
# Details
- The Student Record Management system offer users (Registrar) with a unified view of data from multiple sources. The main objective of this project is to build a student database system that will store records of students. It is purposed to reduce time spent on administrative tasks.this mini project in C Student Record System has a unique style of coding and is presented in a colorful manner. It uses files as database to perform file handling operations such as add, search, modify and delete records to manage studentsâ€™ records.
